1) Does your Xinu shell support an arbitrary number of commands in one pipeline? If yes, how does your program enable it? If no, what is the limit?

No the limit for my program is the number of pipes which is 10.

2) Unix shells allow a pipeline to span multiple lines of input. What two syntactic conventions does a shell use that allow a user to indicate that the pipeline continues on additional lines?

unix uses a space after \ and also uses a space after |.

3)If a user enters x|y|z into a Unix shell and none of x, y, or z is a valid command name, the Unix shell prints three error messages, one for each of x, y, and z. Errors may be due to a user mistyping command names or to a user having an invalid path. How do multiple error messages help identify the cause?

It helps identify the cause by showing which command was invalid.
